        <h3> Hello.</h3>
        <p>
          My name is Luke R. Trujillo and this is my website. I (quickly) created this site as a place for people to see some of the projects I have done over my years and to get my contact information if need be.
        </p>

        <h3>About Me. (My projects are below this)</h3>
        <img class= "me" src="img/me.jpg" />
        <p>
          If you were to ask me in a perfect world what would I do for the rest of my life, I
          would say that I would like to own my tech company that creates assistive technology for the disabled
          ...but also makes video games, app, and a hundred other things too.
        </p>
        <p>
          I love technology. From building my own computer to building software for computers to
          replacing phone screens to soldering circuit boards,  I love it all.
        </p>
        <p>
          But above all else is my passion to help others. I believe that who we are isn't defined by how much
          we know or how much we make, it is defined by how many people we help. I want to apply my skills to help
          those less fortune than myself.

          I was born in 1999 in Boston, MA and since have remained close. I am experienced with around 12 programming languages (I have lost count) and
          have a deep undying passion for math and science. Above all else, I love to learn whether it is useless fun facts or something more
          complex. I am a tinkerer, a maker, but more importantly I am a student for life (and in high school).
        </p>
